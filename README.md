## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are
associated correctly! If you didn't get to try a many-to-many association in your last project (i.e. for likes/faves, shortlist of items, users following/friending other users, etc) this might be a good chance to try out that more challenging database structure.
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid (and unique) email addresses, and secure passwords.
* **Use Gems.** Use a GEM to add extra functionality to your app.
* **Use AJAX.** Make AJAX requests to handle any interactions with your own server that should happen transparently, i.e. without a page reload (such as liking/favouriting a post, adding tags, autocomplete-based search, etc).
* **User Login.** Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up. Ensure that users cannot edit the items created by other users, and that general users cannot access admin-only features!
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.
